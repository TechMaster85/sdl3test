# SDL3 Tests

Uses CMake's FetchContent to build an SDL3 program straight from SDL3 and SDL3_Image's git repo.

This is not intended to be useful to anyone. I'm testing and showing publicly that I think I know what I'm doing.

## How to run

- Have CMake and Ninja installed and accessible from the command line
- Have an Internet connection
- `make setup_config`
- `make all`

This has been tested on Linux. Someone please test on Windows and macOS and tell me if it works.
